# sass
In this repository there will be the lessons and thing that I do learn from starting out in doing SASS. It also contains the work I do in sass from starting out.

## What is SASS?
Sass is a script way of css, which allows for the easier for use of css and linking it. Sass allows the user to use more things with reagards to css such as varibles and just makes it overall easier to write more css.

## How to use SASS:

- Download and install Ruby if you don't have it. ( https://rubyinstaller.org/ )
- Install SASS via the terminal and use command line "gem install sass"
- Create a repository for a project and make the website live.
- Create a base folder structure of css, scss and images.
- Create an index.html file.
- Run the command "sass --watch scss:css".
- Create your base template for your index.html file.
- Create a .scss file.
- Link your index.html file to the css sheet.
